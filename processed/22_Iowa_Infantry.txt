NOTI-zs.— Organized at Iowa City in August, 1862, leaving the State on September 14th. It was stationed
at Rolla, Mo., during the rest of the year, and at other points in Missouri until March, 1863, when it joined
Grant’s Army, then commencing the Vicksburg campaign. It was assigned to Lawler’s (2d) Brigade, Carr‘s
Division, Thirteenth Corps. It was engaged at Port Gibson, the opening battle of the Vicksburg campaign,
where it lost 2 killed and 21 wounded ; was in reserve at Champion’s Hill ; was slightly engaged at Black River
Bridge, where the brigade carried off the honors of the day.

In the assault on Vicksburg, May 22d, it sustained the greatest loss of any regiment engaged, its casualties
amounting to 27 killed, I18 wounded, and I9 missing. The brigade was formed for this assault by column of
regiments, with the Twenty-second in advance, the point of attack being a fort on a hill in front of the column.
The regiment passed the abattis, gained the ditch and planted its ﬂag 011 the parapet, where it remained
waving for nine hours. The assault having failed at other points, the gallant regiment was obliged to abandon
the position which it had fought so hard to gain. At one time during the assault, Sergeant Joseph E. Grifﬁth,
of Company I. with a squad of twenty men, climbed the wall of the fort, and, effecting an entrance, engaged in
a hand-to-hand ﬁght, from which the sergeant and only one man returned alive.

In August, I863, the division (Washburne’s) moved to New Orleans, and the regiment served in that
department during the ensuing twelve months. In July, 1864, the regiment was transferred to the Nineteenth
Corps, with which it proceeded to Virginia and fought under Sheridan in the Shenandoah Valley: At the
battle of the Opequon it lost 1 I killed, 63 wounded, and 31 missing; total, 105. It was then in Molineux’s
(2d) Brigade, Grover’s (2d) Division, Nineteenth Corps.
