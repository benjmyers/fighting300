NOTES.— Organized at Troy, N. Y., and mustered in by companies during September and October, 1862,
the men coming from Rensselaer and Washington counties. The regiment was actively engaged in the
defence of Suffolk, Va., April, 1863, where it served in Foster’s Brigade, Corcoran’s Division. In the following
summer it participated in the Operations about Charleston Harbor, and in May, 1864, it moved with the Army
of the James to Bermuda Hundred. The regiment disembarked there with Butler’s Army, and hard ﬁghting,
with its consequent heavy losses, immediately ensued. At Cold Harbor it fought in Martindale’s Division ; Col-
onel McConihe was killed in that battle. The One Hundred and Sixty-ninth held a perilous position in the
trenches before Petersburg, losing men there, killed or wounded, almost every day. While there, on the evening of
June 30, 1864, the brigade (Barton’s) was ordered to charge the enemy’s lines, so that, under cover of their ﬁre,
Curtis’s Brigade could throw up an advanced riﬂe-pit; but the regiment while going into position was prema-
turely discovered by the enemy, and thereby drew upon themselves a severe ﬁre, which not only frustrated the
plan, but cost the regiment many lives. The regiment was one of those selected for the expedition against Fort
Fisher 3 it was then in Bell’s (3d) Brigade, Ames’s Division, Tenth Corps, and took part in the desperate but
victorious assault on that stronghold. A large proportion of its losses there, however, occurred at the explosion
of the magazine, after the fort had been captured. After the fall of Fort Fisher, the regiment accompanied the
Tenth Corps in its advance on Wilmington. It was mustered out July 19, 1865.
