No1'F.s.— Conspicuous, not only, by its gay uniform, but by its precision: of drill and steady bearing under
ﬁre. General Sykes once wrote that it was the best volunteer organization he ever saw. During all its active
service the Fifth was in the Division of Regulars, and fully maintained its standing and right to be there. In
addition to the great Generals who had served successively as its Colonels, the regiment graduated other noted
ones. Generals Kilpatrick, Davies, and Hamblin having served in its line. Kilpatrick was seriously wounded at
Big licthel while a captain in the Fifth. ’l‘he regiment was recniited in New York City, and was one of the first
to respond to the alarm of war. At Gaines’s Mill, under command of Lieutenant-Colonel lliram Duryca, it faced
a muskctry ﬁre which cut down one-third of its men, and won praises from all who witnessed its remarkable
efﬁciency and drill while in the thickest of that ﬁght; it was in that battle that, after having received several
deadly volleys, it paused at one time while still under ﬁre to “ count ofl' " anew, so that its movements might nut
be deranged by the absence of its fallen men. At Manassas it took 490 into action, of whom I 17 were killed or
mortally wounded. The Fifth was enlisted for two years ; but most of its recruits were enlisted for three years,
and when the regiment was mustered out (May 14, 1863) these men were transferred to the One Hundred and
Forty-sixth New York. After the muster-out of the Fifth, Colonel Winslow organized another regiment which
bore the same number, and which rejoined the Fifth Corps, sharing the fortunes of Grant’s army from the
North Anna to Appomattox. Colonel Winslow fell mortally wounded at Bethesda Church. while in command
of this regiment, and Colonel Frederick Winthrop, who succeeded him, was killed at Five Forks while in com-
mand of the brigade.
