NOTES.—Recruited mostly in Schuylkill County" It left the State in November, 1861, and, arriving in Vir-
ginia soon after, was assigned to Slocum’s Brigade, F ranklin’s Division. General Slocum commanded the division
at Gaines’s Mill, where the regiment was engaged and received a gratifying mention in the Ofﬁcial reports.
Loss, at Gaines’s lllill, 13 killed, 61 wounded, and 13 missing. It again distinguished itself in the successful
charge at Crampton’s Gap, where Major Lewis J. Martin was killed. It sustained the heaviest loss of any
regiment in that action, its casualties amounting to 20 killed and 70 wounded—fully one-fourth of the
number engaged. Still harder ﬁghting and greater losses were encountered in 1864, at Spotsylvania, where the
Ninety-sixth was selected as one of the twelve regiments of the Sixth Corps to take part in Upton’s charge ; it
proved a dearly bought honor, its losses there, and in the other ﬁghting about Spotsylvania, amounting to 31
killed, 115 wounded, and 32 missing; total, 178. During this campaign the regiment was still in the First
Brigade, First Division, Sixth Corps, General Upton commanding the brigade, and General Wright, the division.
Subsequently, General Russell succeeded to the command of the division. Not enough of the men reénlisted
to warrant the continuance of the regimental organization after the expiration of its term of service, which
occurred September 22, 1864, while in the Shenandoah campaign. The original members of the regiment
returned to their homes, and the re'énlisted veterans, together with the recruits, were transferred to the Ninety-
ﬁfth Pennsylvania.
