campaIgn, the regiment served in Boomer’s (3d) Brigade, Quinby’s Division, Seventeenth Corps.

Its ﬁrst encounter with the enemy occurred at the battle of Jackson, May 14th, in which it lost 1 killed and
6 wounded. Two days later it fought at Champion’s Hill, a hard fought ﬁeld, where its casualties amounted to
38 killed, I 13 wounded, and 11 missing ; total, 162. In the assault on Vicksburg, May 22d, it lost 4 killed and
51 wounded ; Colonel Boomer, the brigade commander, lost his life in this action. After the surrender of Vicks-
burg, and the evacuation of Jackson, the division moved to Memphis, where it was transferred to the Fifteenth
