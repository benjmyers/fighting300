NOTEs.-'l‘here was no more brilliant action in the war than the affair at Rappahannock Station, Va., Nov. 7,
1863. The Sixth Maine was the most prominent in that successful ﬁght, although gallantly assisted by the other
regiments of the brigade. The enemy, about 2,000 strong, occupied an intrenched position ; the Sixth Maine,
with uncapped muskets, supported by the Fifth Wisconsin, stormed their works, and springing over them were
engaged in a desperate struggle, some of the ﬁghting being hand to hand ; bayonets were freely used, and in one
case an ofﬁcer thrust his sabre through an ‘antagonist. Good ﬁghting was also done at other points of the line,
the total result being a brilliant victory, with large captures of men and material. But the brunt of the ﬁght fell
on the Sixth. It lost 38 killed, and 101 wounded, out of the 321 present in action 3 and of 21 ofﬁcers engaged,
16 were killed or wounded. This was not the ﬁrst time that the Sixth had leaped the enemy’s breastworks
against the blazing muzzles of a line of riﬂes. In the successful assault on Marye’s Heights, May 3, 1863, the
ﬂag of the Sixth was the ﬁrst to wave over the enemy's works. The regiment was then in the famous “ Light
Division ” of the Sixth Corps. and did not ﬁre a shot during the charge, but carried the works with the bayonet ;
and mention is made of one man in the Sixth who bayoneted two adversaries, and then brained a third with the
butt of a musket. The loss of the regiment in that battle was 23 killed, 11 1 wounded, and 35 missing.
