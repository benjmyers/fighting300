NOTES—The Second Massachusetts was the best ofﬁcered regiment in the entire Army. Its colonel and
lieutenant-colonel were educated at West Point, the latter graduating at the head of his class; the line ofﬁcers
were selected men , for the most part collegians whose education, supplemented by the year of practical service
in the ﬁeld preliminary to the ﬁrst battle, left nothing that could be desired to make them equal in every respect
to any line of ofﬁcers, regulars or volunteers. Of the sixteen ofﬁcers who lost their lives, thirteen were Harvard
men, whose names appear on the bronze tablets in Harvard Memorial Hall. The company oﬂ‘icers were not
elected by the men, as in other volunteer commands, but were selected by the authorities who raised the regiment.
The enlisted men were also above the average in intelligence and soldierly bearing. The Second sustained the
heaviest loss in action of any regiment in the corps. At Cedar Mouutain its casualties were 40 killed, 9 3 wounded,
and 40 missing; at Chancellorsville, 21 killed, 110 wounded, and 7 missing; and at Gettysburg, 23 killed, 109
wounded, and 4 missing, out of 316 engaged. The latter loss occurred within a few minutes, in a hopeless assault
made by the Second,and Twenty-seventh Indiana, which was ordered by a mistake ; the blunder was apparent to
all, but no one faltered, and each soldier did his duty gallantly ; Lieutenant-Colonel Mudge, who was in command,
remarked : “ It is murder, but it’s the order,” and fell dead while waving his sword and cheering on his men.
