Norris—Fourth regiment, Irish Brigade ; a brigade which never lost a flag, although it captured over twenty
stands of colors from the enemy. At Fredericksburg the Eighty-eighth, in company with the brigade, partici-
pated in the gallant but unsuccessful assault on Marye’s Heights. The brigade was then commanded by General
Meagher, and the division by General Hancock. While in line at F redericksburg awaiting the order for the assault.
little sprigs of green were distributed among the men, every ofﬁcer and man in the brigade, including Meagher
and his staff, placing one in his cap. After the assault had failed, a long, well-aligned row of dead lay on the crest
of the hill within a few yards of the Confederate breastworks, and by each pale dead face was a sprig of Irish
green. The brigade became so reduced by losses that the Sixty-third, Sixty-ninth, and Eighty-eighth were.
shortly before Gettysburg, consolidated into two companies each. At that battle, the brigade halted for a few
moments, just as it neared the “ wheatﬁeld," and knelt with uncovered heads while Father Corby. the Chaplain of
the Eighty-eighth, gave them his benediction; the men, rising to their feet, went into action immediately.
Colonel Kelly, who commanded the brigade at Gettysburg, was afterwards killed in the assault on Petersburg,
where he was again in command of the brigade. Major William Horgan fell at Fredericksburg in the desperate
assault on Maryc’s Heights.
