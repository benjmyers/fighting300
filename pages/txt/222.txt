NOTES—Composed mostly of Scotchmen, uniformed in their national costume, the ofﬁcers wearing kilts
and the men wearing pantaloons of the Cameron tartan. After active service commenced, this dress was laid
aside and the United States service uniform was substituted. The men of the Seventy-ninth fully sustained the
honor and military reputation of their native land, and fought for the government of their adoption as gallantly as
ever Scotchmen fought on native soil or on foreign ﬁelds. Previous to the war this regiment had belonged
to the State National Guard, and at the outbreak of hostilities it was among the ﬁrst to tender its services. It
marched to First Bull Run, where it sustained one of the heaviest losses on that ﬁeld, its casualties amounting to
32 killed, 5 I wounded, I I 5 missing or captured. Colonel Cameron, brother of the Secretary of War, was killed
there while in command of the regiment. At the battle of James Island (Secessionville), it was in Stevens’s
Division, and lost I 10 men there out of 474 engaged. In August, I862, the gallant regiment fought again on the
Manassas Plains, and in the actions at Second Bull Run and Chantilly lost 9 killed, 79 wounded, and I7 missing;
total, 105. General Stevens, formerly Colonel Of the Higlanders, was killed at Chantilly, where, after six color-
bearers of the Seventy-mnth had fallen, the General seized the ﬂag and shouting, “Highlanders ! My Highland-
ers ! Follow your General,” led the charge and fell dead amid the cheers of victory with the color-staﬂ' grasped
ﬁrmly in his handcr The regiment’s term of enlistment expired May I 3, I864, the order for muster-out reach-
ing the men while they stood in line on the bloody ﬁeld of Spotsylvania. The recruits were organized into a
battalion which served through the war, doing provost-duty at Corps headquarters.

* Does not include the battalion organized in 1864.
