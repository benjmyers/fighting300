NO'rI-‘s.— The Sixth was organized in August, 1862, under the President’s second call for troops, six of the
companies coming from Baltimore. Leaving that city on September 19, 1862, it proceeded to Williamsport, on
the Upper Potomac, where it joined the Maryland Brigade. It left that brigade in March, 1863, and became a
part of the Third Brigade, Second Division (Milroy’s), Eighth Corps. This division retired before Lee’s advance
to Gettysburg, but not without some hard ﬁghting at Winchester, Va., in which the Sixth was engaged ; it then
moved into Maryland, where it was subsequently assigned to the Third Corps, becoming the Third Division.

The regiment was in the Third Corps at Mine Run, in which affair it took a prominent part, being then in
Keifer’s (2d) Brigade, Carr’s (3d) Division, Third Corps. The principal engagement of the Mine Run campaign
occurred at Locust Grove, a ﬁght which devolved almost wholly on Carr’s Division, and largely on the Sixth
Maryland. In March, 1864, the entire division was transferred to the Sixth Corps, the regiment becoming a
part of the Second Brigade (Col. B. F. Smith’s). Upon its transfer to the Sixth Corps, the division was placed
under the command of General Ricketts. Colonel Howard resigned May 5, 186 3, and was succeeded by Colonel
Hom, who resigned in F ebmary, 1865.

The Sixth fought with signal gallantry in the battles of the Wilderness and Cold Harbor, its losses in the
former action being unusually severe. On July 6, 1864, the division was ordered on transports at City Point, Va.,
and sailed for Baltimore to meet Early’s invasion of Maryland. Owing to delay in transportation, the regiment
did not arrive in time to participate in the battle of the Monocacy, but in time to cover the retreat of Ricketts’s
Division. General Ricketts was wounded at Cedar Creek, and was succeeded by General Seymour. The
regiment did some good ﬁghting in the Valley, and, also, in the final battles of the war. It was mustered out
June 20, 1865.
