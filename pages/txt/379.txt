Upon the consolidation of McCook’s and Crittenden’s Corps into the newly formed Fourth Corps, the
regiment became a part of Steedman’s Brigade, Sheridan's (2d) Division. At the battle of Missionary Ridge,
Sheridan gave it credit for being among the ﬁrst to plant its colors on the enemy’s works. Over three-fourths of
the men having reénlistcd, the organization of the regiment was preserved throughout the war. The division
under Newton participated in the hard lighting of the Atlanta campaign, and under Wagner, fought with
Hood’s Army at Franklin. After the victory at Nashville, the regiment moved to Huntsville, Ala., on January
5, 1865 3 thence in April, to East Tennessee, and from there it went with the Fourth Corps to Texas, where it
was mustered out in September, 1865.
